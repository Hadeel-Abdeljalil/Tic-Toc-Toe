# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game!

## How to play
Player 1 chooses a number, and the corresponding cell is marked with an 'X'.

Player 2 chooses a number, and the corresponding cell is marked with an 'O'.

## RULES
-Players take turns making a move by choosing a number corresponding to an empty cell on the grid.
The game starts with an empty grid, and players alternate turns.
Once a cell is marked, it cannot be changed or overwritten by the other player.

-A player wins by having three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game ends as soon as one player achieves this goal.
If the entire grid is filled without either player getting three in a row, the game is a draw.
